# ScopeScript: Fast Matlab Microscope with Custom Hardware Controller

ScopeScript is a Matlab package for the control of microscopy setup. Custom hardware [controller](https://github.com/mariavmukhina/Custom_TTL_Controller_for_Microscope) is at the heart of this setup for the fastest acquisition in 4D. ScopeScript communicates with Nikon Ti-2 microscope through Matlab-only device adapter and uses uManager device adapters to connect to all periphery devices. ScopeScript also includes software for PI Nanocube nanomanipulator to seamlessly integrate image acquisition with mechanical stimulation of the sample with nanoscale precision. 

This software is a substitution for Nikon's $25K NIS-Elements.

I inhereted the first version of the package from Frederick Chang, a former PhD student in Kleckner Lab at Harvard University.

------------------

## Installation

ScopeScript was tested with Matlab 2017a and requires Parallel Computing Toolbox and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. The latter is only needed for camera calibration. In addition, ScopeScript uses uManager 1.4 (included with the package), Nikon Ti-2 SDK (can be obtained at nisdk.net), PI (Physik Instrumente) MATLAB Driver GCS2 for the controller of Nanocube nanomanipulator (optional).

(1) install Nikon Ti2 SDK and go to Matlab to register Nikon Ti2 ActiveX control in Windows:
```
cd 'C:\Program Files\Nikon\Ti2-SDK\bin';           
!regsvr32 /s NkTi2Ax.dll;
```
(2) create microscope hardware configuration in uManager and export .cfg file;

(3) install PI_MATLAB_Driver_GCS2_Setup.exe (optional, only needed for the nanomanipulator);

(4) in scopeParams.m, set the correct properties.

## (Incomplete) ScopeScript Reference

`` scopeParams `` is a class containing all parameters for image acquisition. Define your experiment here.

### Hardware Control

``  startMicroscope() `` creates ÂµManager cmmcore object, startups the microscope and initializes other hardware

`` initMicroscope() `` sets up Nikon Ti-2 microscope, LEDs and cameras, initiates Nanocube; variable `showROI` defines ROI for `executeFunctions` (z stack acquisition) and `doTimeLapse`, also `showROI` is shown in live mode executed by `livePL` and `liveBF`

### Imaging Control


### Data Management


### Camera Calibration

Useful commands:

initMicroscope           % boot up the system
livePhase                  % run live acquisition with Dia illumination
liveFlour                   % run live acquisition with LED illumination
liveLaser                   % run live acquisition with laser illumination
setupChannel            % changes pre-selected Epi and BF channels and switches filter cubes
executeFunctions       % runs experiments pre-defined in fcScopeParams
doTimeLapse             % runs time lapses of experiments pre-defined in fcScopeParams
finishExperiment        % turns off all LEDs, run every time at the end of imaging session (after the cameras are turned off)

TTL circuit has the following TTL triggers: 'AllFourTTL','ChDTTL','ChCTTL','ChBTTL','ChATTL','BrightFieldTTL','AllOnTTL'. They can be chosen in fcScopeParams. These triggers switch on/off channels. In the case of BF-illumination (ScopeLED), these triggers also allow to set up wavelength of light ('3000K';'4500K';'6500K';'Red ';'Green';'Blue'). livePhase runs with preselected channel '4300K', 1% of intensity. Epi-illuminator (CoolLED) has 16 LEDs separated in Channels A-D. Only one LED per channel and up to 4 channels can be turned on at a time. Combination of filter cube and active wavelengths in each channel has to be picked to set up epi-illumination. It can be done in setupChannel, where you can find few default recipes:
 
   
case {'1-QDot'}  % put here name of filter cube, names of all filter cubes can be listed by calling function 'printAvailableFilterCubes()'
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionA',1);  % turn on all necessary channels
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionB',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionC',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionD',0);

        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','ChannelA',365);  % choose the wavelength for all active channels

        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityA',energy);  % turn on selection of intensity for all active channels
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityB',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityC',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityD',0);


Next, you need to choose appropriate triggers in fcScopeParams. For the example above, you need to trigger channel A: 

        setChannel1  = {{'1-QDot',100},{'4300KBrightField',2}};      % commands the scope to use the sequence of 2 different illumination modes (photoluminescence with excitation in QDot channel and brightfield with illumination with 4300K light)
        function1    = {'takeA3DStack',{'zStack1','ChATTL','zStack1','BrightFieldTTL'}};   % defines parameters of stacks for both illumination modes (stacks are taken in sequence)
        timePoints1  = 0:10:60; % defines parameters of the time lapse delay[sec]:take stack every [sec]:for [sec]
        exposure1    = 100;

The following line defines which recipe to run:
        executeOnly = [1];%[8,4,3,1];

Note that z steps in time-lapses are defined in DAC units, not nm. 

        % z step is defined in DAC units, not nanometers
        %-zStack recipes---------------------------------------------------
        zStack1_N   = 11;
        zStack1_dz  = 500;
        zStack1_z0  = 0;

PI piezo stage was not calibrated to get the conversion factor, but the following ratio can be used as a guide: 

        /* writes 2's complement value to the 16 bit dac
        useful numbers:
        0V = -32768   // 65536 range corresponds to the full range of the stage (220 um)
        5V = 0
        10V = 32767
        250nm step is 75 units (74.473) NB: from an experiment 100 nm is 35 units
        */

Code allows to additionally accelerate the piezo stage. It can be done by sending triangle pulses:



Acceleration is defined by additional voltage ff1_deltaUp and ff1_deltaDown. For each step size they have to be determined empirically. If these parameters are absent for pre-selected step size, z stack will be taken without acceleration.

        ff1_dz          = 300;
        ff1_deltaUp     = 2230;
        ff1_delayUp     = 1;
        ff1_deltaDown   = -1000;
        ff1_delayDown   = 1;

It was found that additional acceleration works only in open-loop mode (faster but less accurate). I could not find a parameters that would allow to decrease acquisition time and keep the stage stable. By default, the stage is set up to slightly slower closed-loop mode to ensure stability, additional acceleration is not used.
