# Software for Microscope Control

To control our Nikon Ti2 microscope we use a custom software, which also requires our custom [controller](https://github.com/mariavmukhina/Custom_TTL_Controller_for_Microscope). It is written in Matlab environment and utilizes [ÂµManager](https://micro-manager.org/) to connect to some of the hardware.

This software is a substitution for Nikon's $25K NIS-Elements.

I inhereted the software from Fred Chang, a former PhD student in Kleckner Lab.


Useful commands:

initMicroscope           % boot up the system
livePhase                  % run live acquisition with Dia illumination
liveFlour                   % run live acquisition with LED illumination
liveLaser                   % run live acquisition with laser illumination
setupChannel            % changes pre-selected Epi and BF channels and switches filter cubes
executeFunctions       % runs experiments pre-defined in fcScopeParams
doTimeLapse             % runs time lapses of experiments pre-defined in fcScopeParams
finishExperiment        % turns off all LEDs, run every time at the end of imaging session (after the cameras are turned off)

TTL circuit has the following TTL triggers: 'AllFourTTL','ChDTTL','ChCTTL','ChBTTL','ChATTL','BrightFieldTTL','AllOnTTL'. They can be chosen in fcScopeParams. These triggers switch on/off channels. In the case of BF-illumination (ScopeLED), these triggers also allow to set up wavelength of light ('3000K';'4500K';'6500K';'Red ';'Green';'Blue'). livePhase runs with preselected channel '4300K', 1% of intensity. Epi-illuminator (CoolLED) has 16 LEDs separated in Channels A-D. Only one LED per channel and up to 4 channels can be turned on at a time. Combination of filter cube and active wavelengths in each channel has to be picked to set up epi-illumination. It can be done in setupChannel, where you can find few default recipes:
 
   
case {'1-QDot'}  % put here name of filter cube, names of all filter cubes can be listed by calling function 'printAvailableFilterCubes()'
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionA',1);  % turn on all necessary channels
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionB',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionC',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','SelectionD',0);

        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','ChannelA',365);  % choose the wavelength for all active channels

        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityA',energy);  % turn on selection of intensity for all active channels
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityB',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityC',0);
        mmc.setProperty('pE4000','IntensityD',0);


Next, you need to choose appropriate triggers in fcScopeParams. For the example above, you need to trigger channel A: 

        setChannel1  = {{'1-QDot',100},{'4300KBrightField',2}};      % commands the scope to use the sequence of 2 different illumination modes (photoluminescence with excitation in QDot channel and brightfield with illumination with 4300K light)
        function1    = {'takeA3DStack',{'zStack1','ChATTL','zStack1','BrightFieldTTL'}};   % defines parameters of stacks for both illumination modes (stacks are taken in sequence)
        timePoints1  = 0:10:60; % defines parameters of the time lapse delay[sec]:take stack every [sec]:for [sec]
        exposure1    = 100;

The following line defines which recipe to run:
        executeOnly = [1];%[8,4,3,1];

Note that z steps in time-lapses are defined in DAC units, not nm. 

        % z step is defined in DAC units, not nanometers
        %-zStack recipes---------------------------------------------------
        zStack1_N   = 11;
        zStack1_dz  = 500;
        zStack1_z0  = 0;

PI piezo stage was not calibrated to get the conversion factor, but the following ratio can be used as a guide: 

        /* writes 2's complement value to the 16 bit dac
        useful numbers:
        0V = -32768   // 65536 range corresponds to the full range of the stage (220 um)
        5V = 0
        10V = 32767
        250nm step is 75 units (74.473) NB: from an experiment 100 nm is 35 units
        */

Code allows to additionally accelerate the piezo stage. It can be done by sending triangle pulses:



Acceleration is defined by additional voltage ff1_deltaUp and ff1_deltaDown. For each step size they have to be determined empirically. If these parameters are absent for pre-selected step size, z stack will be taken without acceleration.

        ff1_dz          = 300;
        ff1_deltaUp     = 2230;
        ff1_delayUp     = 1;
        ff1_deltaDown   = -1000;
        ff1_delayDown   = 1;

It was found that additional acceleration works only in open-loop mode (faster but less accurate). I could not find a parameters that would allow to decrease acquisition time and keep the stage stable. By default, the stage is set up to slightly slower closed-loop mode to ensure stability, additional acceleration is not used.
